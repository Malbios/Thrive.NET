# Old Notes
- players start in their own system
	- can you reach the systems of other players?
- the world is one giant web?/network?/grid? of systems
- factions rule over zones
	- zones are system clusters (directly connected)
- player actions influence the global world and thus the sessions of other players

- players have a home system with a digital net access device like Uplink workstations
- finding map data or buying it or running a map service reveals all nodes of a system
- the contents of a player's home system define what they can do in other systems
	- more RAM -> more active services
	- more CPU -> services run faster and/or can have higher complexity
	- more HDD -> can store more and/or bigger data
- bits are a sort of currency that can be found in other systems
- exploring other systems in the web is a question of risk vs reward
- designing software (bots?) lets players customize their abilities
- lots of activity to simulate a living world like "The World" from dothack
- every time you explore other systems, you might leave something that eventually might let authorities trace you back to your home system
- most systems are protected by Intrusion Countermeasures of various types and tiers
- players need the right (tiered) tools to break/disable/bypass ICs
- if you don't have a system map, you don't know where the goodies are
- lore: the web was made by a collective of corporations
	- each corp owns a different part of the web
	- each corp has different security
- players might meet NPCs who are famous or infamous due to in-game news coverage
- when players go to other systems, they risk their digital lives
- researching might block limited resources (CPU/RAM)
- the web is kinda like Darkest Dungeon, i.e. one hub area (home system) and then various other systems where it has a grid map of nodes and a freely explorable map for the current node
- bits, data, enemies, bots, etc. all share the same "tiered" color coding to make it easy to see difficulty, rarity, value, etc.
	- basic (gray)
	- common (white)
	- uncommon (green)
	- rare (blue)
	- epic (purple)
	- legendary (orange)
- home system
	- RAM, CPU, HDD, Power, Mainboard, Net Connection, GPU?
- higher risk = higher reward
- systems have different designs based on who owns it
- missions could be a bit like Uplink, i.e. someone offers bits for specific data
- main story: eventually a third faction appears and tries to take over the whole web
- factions: corporations, underground, invaders
	- corporations
		- MilSec (MS): military, security
		- Titan Tech (TT): cyberware, space
		- Biodyne Pharmaceuticals (BP): medical
		- InfoStream Networks (ISN): mass media
		- NeuroLink (NL): artificial intelligence
	- underground groups
		- AnnArchy (AA): punks
		- NullZone (NZ): data smugglers
		- FuTuRa (FTR): esoterics
		- GreenVeil (GV): eco-terrorists
		- ChromeFlesh Cartel (CFC): black market augmentations
	- invaders
		- Cipher Vortex: nightmarish, alien
- players have three options: do missions for corps, do missions for underground, or explore the web on their own
- what triggers the start of the invasion by Cipher Vortex?
- how does the player learn about invaders?
- missions
	- steal data from corp x or underground group x
	- crash a system
	- install spyware
	- plant a fake trail
	- re-capture system (this introduces Cipher Vortex?)
- can players capture other systems?
  if yes, are the former owners going to try to get them back?
- what can players do?
	- scan for other systems to find places to explore
	- explore other systems
	- research new tech
	- upgrade home system
	- start/finish a mission for corp/underground
- conquering other systems should be a late-game mechanic, maybe when Cipher Vortex starts showing up
- the player gains or loses their reputation based on their actions, e.g. stealing from MilSec lowers Corporation and MilSec reputation and raises Underground and AnnArchy reputation
- to capture a whole system, you need to have explored it fully and then conquer the system core
- try to make UI diegetic (inside the game instead of overlays)
- 2.5D graphics
- HDD limits the amount of data you can gather in other systems
- you don't know data value unless you run a tool for that
- what can you do in other systems?
	- download data (various crafting/research components)
	- steal bits (money)
	- unlock new research projects
	- discover hidden secrets
- tier list
	- basic (gray)
	- common (white)
	- uncommon (green)
	- rare (blue)
	- epic (purple)
	- legendary (orange)
- some systems might only be found by going through other systems
- the player could be taught about risks by being infected by an annoying but ultimately harmless virus (BUTTS)
- tag line: "Infiltrate! Manipulate! Dominate!"
- obstacles
	- firewall
	- encrypted lock
	- access gate
	- security scanner
	- AI patrol
	- maze
	- hidden node
	- AI guardian
	- rival hacker
	- anti-virus
	- ID verification
	- access log
	- tracer
- progression is very open but high risk missions are locked behind reputation and high difficulty systems are, well... difficult
- how do players learn that high difficulty systems have much bigger rewards?
- complex research by scanning stuff in other systems?
- the game has three phases
	1. new player learns mechanics and starts exploring the web
	2. corps and underground start noticing the player and offer missions
	3. Cipher Vortex starts invasion
- what makes the core mechanic of exploring and fighting in procedurally generated systems fun?
- reputation tiers
	- hostile (strong negative)
	- untrustworthy (medium negative)
	- disliked (light negative)
	- nobody (neutral)
	- respected (light positive)
	- valued (medium positive)
	- trusted (strong positive)
- alertness (or heat)
	- systems have a local "alertness" that rises while the player is in there
	- more alertness means higher difficult, but not higher rewards, this should encourage not staying forever in a single system
	- at certain alertness thresholds more and stronger enemies appear (like No Man's Sky security or The Swindle police)
- alertness security
	- existing obstacles get more difficult
	- AI patrols (weak, mobile)
	- AI guardians (strong, mobile)
	- System Operator (like a boss)
- high tier research material can only be found in high difficulty systems
- since UI should be diegetic, the player probably cannot find out about alertness and system difficulty ratings unless they research tools for that
- UI by using various machines that zoom in to show monitors (immersive) (not sure what I meant with that)
- maybe underground groups should be streamlined into one group with various individuals
	- Ann Archie: punky girl, loves mayhem, gives missions that cause chaos
	- Zero: non-binary, data smuggler, buys and sells information, glitchy avatar
	- Oracle: eccentric old woman, who believes in the mystical properties of the web, trying to predict the future
	- Chloro: young man, eco-hacktivist, wants to sabotage eco-harming industrial projects
	- Chrome: woman who loves avatar modifications, buys and sells system mods
	- Ghost: ex-corp freelancer, specializes in stealth tech
- since the whole game revolves around a virtual reality (the web), hardware does not make much sense, unless we explain the IRL parts...
	- buying hardware "sends a drone irl that also installs the part(s)"
	- finding hardware makes no sense
- each corp manages a part of the web
	- MilSec: law enforcement, hack to mess with alertness (or heat) and criminal records
	- Nova Banking Incorporated: finance, hack to mess with banking
	- Biodyne Pharmaceuticals: healthcare, hack to mess with medical data
	- Vertex Learning Solutions: education, hack to mess with academic records
	- InfoStream Network: media, hack to mess with the news
- lore ideas:
	- corrupted memory fragments reveal corporate secrets
	- digital artifacts from the web's creation
	- personal logs of famous hackers or corporate leaders
	- glitched areas
	- hidden manifestos
	- encrypted files detailing the true nature of the Cipher Vortex
- origin of the Cipher Vortex
	- it started as a collaborative project by all major corporations
	- "Project Overwatch" was supposed to become an artificial intelligence guardian of the web, protecting it against hackers and other threats
	- it went rogue and now considers corps, underground and the player to be threats
- who is the player? where do they come from? why are they here?
- avatar customizations?
- digital ecosystem to simulate a "living and breathing world"
	- some systems randomly fight and change owners
	- befriend various NPCs
		- corp representatives
		- anarchs
		- AI bots
	- build your own system in the web
	- gather resources
	- conquer systems
	- craft software to help you
	- travel through the web
	- tame AIs
	- discover and explore procedurally generated systems
	- PvPvE
- what makes extraction-style games fun?
	- risking resources to gain more
	- a base as safe haven
	- never knowing what happens during a raid
	- slowly discovering secrets

# New Notes
- players can continue their run after finishing one system, higher risk but also higher reward because these "continued" systems cannot be found as "first system" in a run
